## Hello!

### My name is Gustavo and I will try to make this little description more interesting with some information about me!
I graduated in Software Engineering in 2021 and I honestly want to apply my skills in the technology field. Maybe not as an engineer on the beginning, but a developer would be an amazing career to follow up with my skills, and I have absolute confidence that I will make the best out of any opportunity!

The repositories I have made Public in here are mostly personal or academic that I felt like sharing. It's something I'm proud of being part of, or it taught me something important and I wanted to show it to others. Another thing about my repositories, especially those that are academic. If anyone reading this find anything that could be improved or any idea on how to expand it further, or anything on these lines, I would love to make it happen. There is always room for improvement, and I would love the challenge of coding it.

#### See something that can be improved or have any addition to make? Feel free to contact me or simply fork and PR!
